This web app is desinged to pair with a mySQL db to store and access recipes for the user.
For my personal implementation I am using a raspberry pi 2 modle b to host everything. 

Please feel free to fork and modify things that you see fit, I will be investigating a way 
to get how the db is designed on here as well so users can create that as well.
